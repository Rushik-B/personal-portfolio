# Personal Portfolio Website in React

Built using:

- Front-end library: React
- CSS framework: React-bootstrap
- CSS animations library: Animate.css


I chose the MIT License for my portfolio website because it’s simple, flexible, and aligns with my goals as a student developer. Here’s my reasoning:

- **Simplicity**: The license is short and easy to understand, letting me focus on showcasing my coding skills rather than legal complexities.
- **Freedom for others**: It allows anyone to use, modify, or distribute my code—even commercially—without requiring them to share their changes. This fits my desire to encourage collaboration and learning.
- **Low maintenance**: Since my portfolio is personal and educational, MIT avoids complicated contributor agreements while still protecting my original work.

For a project aimed at showcasing my technical ability, MIT strikes the perfect balance between openness and practicality.
